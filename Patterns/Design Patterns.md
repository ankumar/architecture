**2. Data, Storage & Databases:**
* "In an “always-on” world, downtime is unacceptable, and developers were forced into handling the reduced consistency levels of scalable NoSQL systems" . "Over the past decade, application developers have discovered that it is extremely difficult to build bug-free applications over database systems that do not guarantee consistency." http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2018/09/newsql-database-systems-are-failing-to.html?m=1
