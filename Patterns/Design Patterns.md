[Specifications](../System/Specs.md)


##

**"Well Architected"** - Ideally need **set of Abstractions, Crisp boundaries, Clear separation of concerns, and a balanced set of responsibilities...**

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture)
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-microsoft-azure-wellarchitected-framework/)

**Computing:**

2. [State at the edge](https://www.fastly.com/blog/state-at-the-edge)

**Data, Storage & Databases:**
* "In an “always-on” world, downtime is unacceptable, and developers were forced into handling the reduced consistency levels of scalable NoSQL systems" . "Over the past decade, application developers have discovered that it is extremely difficult to build bug-free applications over database systems that do not guarantee consistency." http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2018/09/newsql-database-systems-are-failing-to.html?m=1
