People enjoyed being there.."

> "Instead of amplifying the constant whining about how everything is broken, we should be encouraging people to learn how to navigate ambiguity and mess. Software isn’t perfect, won’t ever be perfect, and perhaps isn’t meant to be perfect. Let’s learn how to better deal with it. Not to be confused with learning how to survive in toxic or dysfunctional workplaces. That’s different. Felt I had to say it, because inevitably someone will be in my mentions talking about how some things can’t be fixed and it’s better to cut your losses soon. "

> "The most common questions I get from customers – whether it be developers or executives – are targeted at understanding how Amazon is able to move so quickly. They want to know about our company culture, our organizational structure, the internal tools we use, and the type of people we hire, just to name a few. Of course, there’s no single answer here. Further, what might be a challenge at one company isn’t necessarily the same at another. But there’s one thing I’ve found that’s as close to a silver bullet as you can get – Developers. More specifically, it’s about hiring the right kinds of developers and then empowering them to do what they do best – build."

> The term “sociotechnical” seems to have gotten a bit or renaissance lately, which is a great thing given all the positive impact it has had on many organisations and their workers around the world over the years. It also seems to have gotten some traction outside the academic circles this time after being developed and pushed from there mostly using action research since its humble beginning in the post-war British coal mines. It is an entry into systems thinking for many, with its idea about joint optimisation of both the technical and social aspects of an organisation. A common example is setting up the team topology to match the service architecture in an attempt to cater for negative effects of Conway’s law. This is all well and good, but if we think about it, viewing the modern organisation as a sociotechnical system is a bit of a tautology; all organisations have social and technical elements that people deal with on a daily basis. As with systems thinking, the value of sociotechnical system design is more about perspective and understanding rather than any specific outcome. There is so much more to sociotechnical design than DevOps and team setup that we need in order to cope in our increasingly complex and hazardous “digital coal mines.” -- [Systems thinking in general and open sociotechnical systems](https://stream.syscoi.com/2021/11/23/open-sociotechnical-systems-thinking-with-trond-hjorteland-youtube/)
