# Quality Attributes

## Collaboration

> The gap is widening, and there is no easy path to catch up. It's not for lack of technology, so there is no magic solution to buy. The necessary competence resides in product companies, so consultants is not the solution
>
> We need to find new ways to collaborate. We are trying one

## Organization

> "Funding was stable, the way that Bell Labs was funded was that a very small tax was applied to any time you made a phone call in the United States a tiny slice of the money involved would go to Bell Labs to improve future telephone service and so that helped that meant that you could count on having revenue to support research for a long time , the organization was very stable , people stayed there for many many years & the company itself took an exceptionally broad and long-term view the job was to improve communication systems and that’s going to be a problem for a long time so almost anything you wanted to work on was arguably relevant to building better telephone systems and so that meant the company was not run by the quarter of a year it was run by multi-year period and all of this led to an environment which is also very cooperative and just plain fun. People enjoyed being there.."

## Build

> "Instead of amplifying the constant whining about how everything is broken, we should be encouraging people to learn how to navigate ambiguity and mess. Software isn’t perfect, won’t ever be perfect, and perhaps isn’t meant to be perfect. Let’s learn how to better deal with it. Not to be confused with learning how to survive in toxic or dysfunctional workplaces. That’s different. Felt I had to say it, because inevitably someone will be in my mentions talking about how some things can’t be fixed and it’s better to cut your losses soon. "

> "The most common questions I get from customers – whether it be developers or executives – are targeted at understanding how Amazon is able to move so quickly. They want to know about our company culture, our organizational structure, the internal tools we use, and the type of people we hire, just to name a few. Of course, there’s no single answer here. Further, what might be a challenge at one company isn’t necessarily the same at another. But there’s one thing I’ve found that’s as close to a silver bullet as you can get – Developers. More specifically, it’s about hiring the right kinds of developers and then empowering them to do what they do best – build."

> Developers are the creative workforce who can solve critical business problems and create hit products for customers — not just "code monkeys" who grind through rote tasks. Companies that bring software developers in as partners are winning.
